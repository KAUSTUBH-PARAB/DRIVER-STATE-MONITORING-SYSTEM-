# DRIVER-STATE-MONITORING-SYSTEM-

DSMS_PRO is an AI-based Driver Safety Monitoring System that uses computer vision to detect driver drowsiness and distractions in real-time. It leverages OpenCV, MediaPipe, and deep learning models to enhance road safety and prevent accidents.

## 🚀 Features

- Real-time drowsiness detection using eye aspect ratio
- Distraction detection using pose and hand tracking
- Audio alerts using Pygame
- Lightweight and fast performance on mid-level systems
- SQLite-based local database logging

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Python
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- MediaPipe
- NumPy
- Pygame
- SQLite3
